# Smart-Delivery-Robot
This is a Python project called "Smart Delivery Robot", in which, having AI as a concept; I created a program where I simulate a delivery's robot journey to deliver packages to people on a simulated enviroment like a city, which is represented as a grid which dimensions are entered by the user.
# Why is this proyect important?
- Because it will show companies a method of delivering all types of packages in a faster and pollution-free way.
- This also will also show students how to code in Python in an elegant and simplified way, they will learn how to use algorythms such as Manhattan Distance, and to use libraries like "time", which in this case simulates real time navigation.
